%% Multisignal 1-D Wavelet Analysis
% A 1-D multisignal is a set of 1-D signals of same length stored
% as a matrix organized rowwise (or columnwise).
%
% The purpose of this example is to show how to analyze, denoise or compress
% a multisignal, and then to cluster different representations or simplified
% versions of the signals composing the multisignal.
%
% In this example, the signals are first analyzed and different  
% representations or simplified versions are produced:
%
% * Reconstructed approximations at given levels,
%
% * Denoised versions,
%
% * Compressed versions.
%
% Denoising and compressing are two of the main applications of wavelets,
% often used as a preprocessing step before clustering.
%
% The last step of this example performs several clustering strategies and
% compare them. It allows to summarize a large set of signals using sparse
% wavelet representations.

%% Load and Plot a Multisignal
% To illustrate these capabilities, let us consider a real-life 
% multisignal representing 35 days of an electrical load consumption,  
% centered and standardized.

load elec35_nor;       % Load normalized original data.
X = signals;
[nbSIG,nbVAL] = size(X);
plot(X','r');
axis tight
title('Original Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
xlabel('Minutes from 1 to 1440');

%%
% We can see that the signals are locally irregular and noisy but 
% nevertheless three different general shapes can be distinguished.

%% Surface Representation of Data
% In order to highlight the periodicity of the multisignal, let us now examine 
% the data using a 3-D  representation.

surf(X);
shading interp
axis tight
title('Original Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
xlabel('Minutes from 1 to 1440','Rotation',4);
ylabel('Days from 1 to 35','Rotation',-60);
ax = gca;
ax.View = [-13.5 48];

%%
% The five weeks represented can now be seen more clearly.

%% Multisignal Row Decomposition
% Perform a wavelet decomposition at level 7 using the ' _sym4_ ' wavelet.
dirDec = 'r';         % Direction of decomposition
level  = 7;           % Level of decomposition  
wname  = 'sym4';      % Near symmetric wavelet
decROW = mdwtdec(dirDec,X,level,wname);

%%
% The generated decomposition structure is as follows:
decROW


%% Signals and Approximations at Level 7
% Let us reconstruct the approximations at level 7 for each row 
% signal. Then, to compare the approximations with the original signals,
% let us display two plots (see figure below).
% The first one shows all the original signals and the second one shows all 
% the corresponding approximations at level 7.

A7_ROW  = mdwtrec(decROW,'a',7);

subplot(2,1,1);
plot(X(:,:)','r');
title('Original Data');
axis tight 
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(A7_ROW(:,:)','b');
axis tight
title('Corresponding approximations at level 7');

%%
% As it can be seen, the general shape is captured by the approximations at 
% level 7, but some interesting features are lost. For example, the bumps
% at the beginning and at the end of the signals disappeared.

%% Superimposed Signals and Approximations
% To compare more closely the original signals with their corresponding
% approximations at level 7, let us display two plots (see figure below).
% The first one concerns the four first signals and the second one the five
% last signals. Each of these plots represents the original signals 
% superimposed with their corresponding approximation at level 7.

subplot(2,1,1);
idxDays = 1:4;
plot(X(idxDays,:)','r');
hold on
plot(A7_ROW(idxDays,:)','b');
axis tight
title(['Days ' int2str(idxDays), ' - Signals and Approximations at level 7']);
subplot(2,1,2);
idxDays = 31:35;
plot(X(idxDays,:)','r');
hold on
plot(A7_ROW(idxDays,:)','b');
axis tight
title(['Days ' int2str(idxDays), ' - Signals and Approximations at level 7']);

%%
% As it can be seen, the approximation of the original signal is visually 
% accurate in terms of general shape.

%% Multisignal Denoising
% To perform a more subtle simplification of the multisignal preserving
% these bumps which are clearly attributable to the electrical signal, let
% us denoise the multisignal.
%
% The denoising procedure is performed using three steps: 
%
% 1) *Decomposition* : Choose a wavelet and a level of decomposition N, 
% and then compute the wavelet decompositions of the signals at level N. 
%
% 2) *Thresholding* : For each level from 1 to N 
% and for each signal, a threshold is selected and thresholding is 
% applied to the detail coefficients.  
%
% 3) *Reconstruction* : Compute wavelet reconstructions using the original
% approximation coefficients of level N and the modified detail
% coefficients of levels from 1 to N.
%
% Let us choose now the level of decomposition N = 5 instead of N = 7 
% used previously.

dirDec = 'r';         % Direction of decomposition
level  = 5;           % Level of decomposition  
wname  = 'sym4';      % Near symmetric wavelet
decROW = mdwtdec(dirDec,X,level,wname);

[XD,decDEN] = mswden('den',decROW,'sqtwolog','mln');
Residuals = X-XD;

subplot(3,1,1);
plot(X','r');

title('Original Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
subplot(3,1,2);
plot(XD','b');

title('Denoised Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
subplot(3,1,3);
plot(Residuals','k'); 
axis tight
title('Residuals');
xlabel('Minutes from 1 to 1440');
%%
% The quality of the results is good. The bumps at the beginning and at the
% end of the signals are well recovered and, conversely, the residuals look
% like a noise except for some remaining bumps due to the signals.
% Furthermore, the magnitude of these remaining bumps is of a small order.

%% Multisignal Compressing Row Signals
% Like denoising, the compression procedure is performed using three steps 
% (see above). 
%
% The difference with the denoising procedure is found in step 2. There
% are two compression approaches available:
%
% * The first one consists of taking the wavelet expansions of the signals 
% and keeping the largest absolute value coefficients. In this case, you can
% set a global threshold, a compression performance, or a relative square
% norm recovery performance. Thus, only a single signal-dependent parameter 
% needs to be selected. 
%
% * The second approach consists of applying visually determined
% level-dependent thresholds. 
%
% To simplify the data representation and to make more efficient the compression, 
% let us go back to the decomposition at level 7 and compress each row of the
% multisignal by applying a global threshold leading to recover 99% of the
% energy.

dirDec = 'r';         % Direction of decomposition
level  = 7;           % Level of decomposition  
wname  = 'sym4';      % Near symmetric wavelet
decROW = mdwtdec(dirDec,X,level,wname);

[XC,decCMP,THRESH] = mswcmp('cmp',decROW,'L2_perf',99);

subplot(3,1,1);
plot(X','r');
axis tight
title('Original Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
subplot(3,1,2);
plot(XC','b');
axis tight
title('Compressed Data: 35 days of electrical consumption');
subplot(3,1,3); 
plot((X-XC)','k');
axis tight
title('Residuals');
xlabel('Minutes from 1 to 1440');

%%
% As it can be seen, the general shape is preserved while the local
% irregularities are neglected. The residuals contain noise as well as
% components due to the small scales essentially.

%% Compression Performance
% Let us now compute the corresponding densities of nonzero elements. 

cfs = cat(2,[decCMP.cd{:},decCMP.ca]);
cfs = sparse(cfs);
perf = zeros(1,nbSIG);
for k = 1:nbSIG
    perf(k) = 100*nnz(cfs(k,:))/nbVAL;
end

figure('Color','w')
plot(perf,'r-*');
title('Percentages of nonzero coefficients for the 35 days');
xlabel('Signal indices');
ylabel('% of nonzero coefficients');

%%
% For each signal, the percentage of required coefficients to recover 
% 99% of the energy lies between 1.25% and 1.75%. This illustrates the 
% spectacular capacity of wavelets to concentrate signal energy in few 
% coefficients.

Stats_TBX_Flag = isstatstbxinstalled;
if ~Stats_TBX_Flag
    WarnStr = isstatstbxinstalled('msg');
    uiwait(msgbox(WarnStr,...
        'Using clustering tools','warn','modal'));

    'Denoising, compression and clustering using wavelets are very efficient'

    return
end

%% Clustering Row Signals
% Let us now compare three different clustering of the 35 days. 
% The first one is based on the original multisignal, the second 
% one on the approximation coefficients at level 7 and the last 
% one on the denoised multisignal.
%
% Using the GUI to inspect the dendrogram related to the clustering
% process (not reported here), let us set to 3 the number of clusters.
% Then, let us compute the structures P1 and P2 which contain respectively
% the two first partitions and the third one.

P1 = mdwtcluster(decROW,'lst2clu',{'s','ca7'},'maxclust',3);
P2 = mdwtcluster(decDEN,'lst2clu',{'s'},'maxclust',3);
Clusters = [P1.IdxCLU P2.IdxCLU];

%%
% We can now test the equality of the three partitions.
EqualPART = isequal(max(diff(Clusters,[],2)),[0 0])
%%
% So the three partitions are the same. Let us now plot and 
% examine the clusters.
figure('Color','w')
stem(Clusters,'filled','b:')
title('The three clusters of the original 35 days');
xlabel('Signal indices');
ylabel('Index of cluster');
ax = gca;
xlim([1 35]);
ylim([0.5 3.1]);
ax.YTick = 1:3;

%%
% The first cluster (labelled 3) contains 25 mid-week days and the two   
% others (labelled 2 and 1) contain 5 saturdays and 5 sundays respectively.
% This illustrates again the periodicity of the underlying time series 
% and the three different general shapes seen in the two first plots
% displayed at the beginning of this example.
%
% Let us now display the original signals and the corresponding
% approximation coefficients used to obtain two of the three partitions.
%

%%
CA7 = mdwtrec(decROW,'ca');
IdxInCluster = cell(1,3);
for k = 1:3
    IdxInCluster{k} = find(P2.IdxCLU==k);
end
figure('Color','w','Units','normalized','Position',[0.2 0.2 0.6 0.6])
for k = 1:3
    idxK = IdxInCluster{k};
    subplot(2,3,k); 
    plot(X(idxK,:)','r');  
    axis tight
    ax = gca;
    ax.XTick = [200 800 1400];
    if k==2
        title('Original signals');
    end
    xlabel(['Cluster: ' int2str(k) ' (' int2str(length(idxK)) ')']);
    subplot(2,3,k+3); 
    plot(CA7(idxK,:)','b');
    axis tight
    if k==2
        title('Coefficients of approximations at level 7');
    end
    xlabel(['Cluster: ' int2str(k) ' (' int2str(length(idxK)) ')']);    
end 

%%
% The same partitions are obtained from the original signals (1440 samples
% for each signal) and from the coefficients of approximations at level 7 
% (18 samples for each signal). This illustrates that using less than 2% 
% of the coefficients is enough to get the same clustering partitions of 
% the 35 days.

%% Summary
% Denoising, compression and clustering using wavelets are very efficient
% tools. The capacity of wavelet representations to concentrate signal
% energy in few coefficients is the key of efficiency.
% In addition, clustering offers a convenient procedure to summarize a 
% large set of signals using sparse wavelet representations.
